      <div class="bg-text-top"> In some stores today, particularly grocery stores, we can see a change in the checkout
        area. Today there are machines that allow you to register and pay for your own groceries.
        The checkout process can be more efficient as you no longer need to wait in a queue.
        This new “dehumanizing” technology is already used and developed in Amazon Go
        (Wankhede et al., 2018). The cashier system is replaced with new advanced computer
        technology and artificial intelligence. The technology created there allows “just walk out
        shopping”. The negative effects related to this is that it will eventually take away job
        opportunities in the job market, and it will especially affect and target young humans and
        people with no education. A lot of these service jobs don’t require an education or a lot of
        experience. Therefore, they are easier to accomplish.
        A more digitized store will widen the distance between the workers and the customers. We
        can say that the shops are becoming more dehumanizing and are not dependent on us
        humans. It’s like the value of the cashier and the job that they do is not important anymore,
        and the customer service that they provide. From our perspective, with a past working in
        different stores, we have experienced that a lot of people enjoy talking to the cashier. A
        machine can not provide the same qualities of a human. It can not read people, understand
        or help like humans can, nor communicate with emotions and compassion. The social
        community that some people experience in the store will no longer exist. </div>
